# runpodctl
runpodctl is a CLI tool to automate / manage GPU pods for [runpod.io](https://runpod.io).

**Please note that there is a breaking change in 1.8.0 that is incompatible with previous versions. You can check your version by typing**
```
runpodctl version
```

All pods automatically come with runpodctl installed with a pod-scoped API key!

## how to transfer data
Using send or receive command does not require API keys due to built-in security of one-time codes.

Run the following on the computer that has the file you want to send
```
runpodctl send data.txt
```

The command should output something like
```
Sending 'data.txt' (5 B)
Code is: 8338-galileo-collect-fidel
On the other computer run

runpodctl receive 8338-galileo-collect-fidel
```

Run the following on the computer that you want to send the file to
```
runpodctl receive 8338-galileo-collect-fidel
```

It should start transferring with output that looks like
```
Receiving 'data.txt' (5 B)

Receiving (<-149.36.0.243:8692)
data.txt 100% |████████████████████| ( 5/ 5B, 0.040 kB/s)
```

# how to manage pods
Visit [docs](doc/runpodctl.md) for details of all commands.

First configure the API key. You can get API key from [runpod](https://runpod.io/client/settings).
```
runpodctl config --apiKey={key}
```
Get all pods:
```
runpodctl get pod
```
Get a pod:
```
runpodctl get pod {podId}
```
Start an ondemand pod.
```
runpodctl start pod {podId}
```
Start a spot pod with bid. The bid price you set is the price you will pay if not outbid:
```
runpodctl start pod {podId} --bid=0.3
```
Stop a pod:
```
runpodctl stop pod {podId}
```

# script to stop all pods
 
This can be used in a cron job to prevent cost overages. 

 `./runpodctl get pod | tail +2 | egrep RUNNING | cut -f 1 | xargs ./runpodctl stop pod`
